# Apply-Doc-Manager

I am not a fan of Excel or Google Docs for storing search-needing informations, so I made this to manage my documents during the scientific apply procedure. Please note that it's not a commercial programm and is basic.

## Requirements
You can install the dependencies by running:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use
Clone the repo and from its directory run `python3 apply_doc_manager.py` then go to this url in a browser: `http://localhost:8080`. Keep in mind that all the data is stored in a .db file which is located in the cloned directory, so if you want your information DON'T delete the folder.
